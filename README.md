# SMUL-Enviornment-Sound-Classification
This project explores advanced environmental sound classification using CNNs and transfer learning, leveraging weakly labeled web audio for sound event detection. Data augmentation techniques like pitch shifting, time stretching, and noise additio. A LinearSVC is used for classification, achieving state-of-the-art results on the ESC-50 dataset.
